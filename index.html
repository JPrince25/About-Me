        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Jacob actually. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Mathematics and
          Computer Science at Lewis University. But, for the personal stuff, I
          was born on November 28, 2001 in the town of Lockport, Illinois. Here
          I have stayed for the past 22 years with my parents: Glen and Jane. My
          father was once a carpenter before he changed his career to work for
          the Will County Highway Department. My mother works for Linly Designs
          as a floral designer but during her free time she can be found
          gardening professionally as she wants to open up a flower business for
          homegrown flowers. I'm an only child, but I consider my three best
          friends that I have known since Kindergarten to be my brothers. Joe
          also attends Lewis and is looking to dursue electrial engineer when he
          doesn't have a book underneath his nose. Cole was in the Marines
          before he had to be medically removed, now he is also pursuing a
          career in HVAC. Tom is still an active member of the Marines as a
          welder who has been away more on deployment. During our free time we
          can often be found playing some sort of video game or board game
          together as there is nothing better than a good game and good company.
          I also have been involved in volleyball for the past 11 years. I used
          to actually coach for my high school's JV boys' volleyball team until
          last spring. I'm still occationally involved though as I do my best to
          be help to our women's volleyball team here at Lewis when I can.

        <h4>My Favorite Hobby</h4>
        <p>
          One of my favorite hobbies besides video games, is to read. Although I
          have a vast selection of classical literature, my main passion comes
          in the form of comic books. Ever since high school, I started to
          collect graphic novels for Batman, Nightwing, Batgirl, John
          Constantine, Moon Knight and Spider-Man. Now I have a massive shelf
          filled to the brim even after adding some manual attachments to it.
          Over the years I also been collecting specific issues that are either
          visually impressive, key moments in history, or the single issue forms
          of my favorite stories. The goal would be to eventually get frames for
          them to be displayed on the walls of my study.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion for these stories and the media has driven me down a path
          where I would someday like to write and draw my own comic books. Of
          course, the idea is to follow some sort of computer science career,
          but on the side I want to hone my writing skills on the side. Who
          knows, I might be able to find a career where I will have to do both.
          That would be the dream.

        <h5>Fun Fact</h5>
        <p>
          Last semester I decided to tryout drumming in the Rock Band Ensemble Class. Although I am still very new at it, I enjoy it a lot. I decided to continue to participate this year as well. Hopefully all goes well and we have good performances again as the group is a little different but that just makes things more exciting.
